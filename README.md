The LS-Wing is a multitask hardware controller. It has 6 rows of 10 buttons and 10 faders, all of them configurable twice on two pages.    
Initially it controls the LightShark LS-1 and LS-Core (Modes 1 to 3); but it can also be configured as a pure MIDI-controller (Mode4) or OSC/UDP controller (Mode5)

the LS-Wing can also be controlled by DMX-Remote and the LS-Wing integrate two Nodes (ArtNet or ACN versus DMX).    
All these features make the LS-Wing quite unique and versatile.
